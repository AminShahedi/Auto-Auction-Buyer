Features:
Scans the Auction House screen in World of Warcraft (Dragonflight version) and automatically purchases cheap items.
Supports adding Bait items.


<b>What exactly does this program do?</b>

1. It scans the screen and retrieves the price of the first item in the Auction House using Tesseract (a sample of the scanned page is in the link below).


2. If the quantity is greater than 1 and the price is lower than the specified amount, it proceeds with the purchase and announces the number of items bought using TTS (Text-to-Speech).
